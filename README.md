# Phone Words

Instructions

1. Locate into the phone-words-back directory and install the dependencies using `npm install`

2. Locate into the phone-words-front directory and install the dependencies using `npm install`

3. Start the backend by `node server.js`

4. Start the frontend by `npm start` and go to http://localhost:3000/

My work is contained in these files
- phone-words-back/letterCombos.js
- phone-words-back/server.js
- phone-words-front/src/App.js

Limitations

I have not written code for
- input validations (0 and 1 can be accepted though they should not be)
- error handling on the front-end 
- I was not able to meet the requirement for generating an accurate list of phonewords
